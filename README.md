# EmotionDetection
This project identifies various emotions of person by just seeing the facial expressions.

This dataset has 48*48 gray scale images and we have built a classifcation model to predict the emotions in an image.

Classes:1.angry 2.disguist 3.fear 4.happy 5.neutral 6.sad 7.surprise

Libraries used:

Opencv haarcascade
numpy
matplotlib
tensorflow

The images have been pre-processed before sent to convolutional neural networks.

These images are passes to VGG16 and Xception neural where the accuracy is more , but the model was not performing well with real time data.

We have built the model with Convolutional neural network which gives better accuracy than other two models.

Below are the results:
